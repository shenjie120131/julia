# Package Documentation

This directory contains per‑package documentation for the consolidated Julia packages derived from Jherek Healy’s repositories. Each Markdown file summarizes the package’s purpose, key features, dependencies and notes for porting to C++ with Python wrappers.

The included packages are:

- **PPInterpolation** – piecewise‑polynomial interpolation routines.
- **CharFuncPricing** – derivative pricing using characteristic functions.
- **AQFED** – financial engineering and derivative pricing algorithms.
- **LaverySpline** – rational cubic spline interpolation.
- **MonteCarloMeanVarianceExamples** – Monte‑Carlo mean/variance examples.
- **Roots** – numerical root‑finding algorithms.

Refer to `Julia_to_C++_porting.md` in the `docs` directory for a comprehensive migration guide and cross‑package dependency analysis.
